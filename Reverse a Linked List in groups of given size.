Given a linked list of size N. The task is to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function) in the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should be considered as a group and must be reversed (See Example 2 for clarification).

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->2->4->5->6->7->8
K = 4
Output: 4 2 2 1 8 7 6 5 
Explanation: 
The first 4 elements 1,2,2,4 are reversed first 
and then the next 4 elements 5,6,7,8. Hence, the 
resultant linked list is 4->2->2->1->8->7->6->5.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
K = 3
Output: 3 2 1 5 4 
Explanation: 
The first 3 elements are 1,2,3 are reversed 
first and then elements 4,5 are reversed.Hence, 
the resultant linked list is 3->2->1->5->4.







  Reverse a linked list
  The input list will have at least one element  
  Return the node which points to the head of the new LinkedList
  Node is defined as 
    struct node
    {
        int data;
        struct node* next;
    
        node(int x){
            data = x;
            next = NULL;
        }
    
    }*head;
*/

class Solution
{
    public:
    struct node *reverse (struct node *head, int k)
    { 
        // Complete this method
        int count=0;
        struct node* prevpt=NULL;
        struct node* currpt=head;
        struct node* nextpt=NULL;
        while(currpt!=NULL && count<k)
        {
            nextpt=currpt->next;
            currpt->next= prevpt;
            prevpt=currpt;
            currpt=nextpt;
            count++;
        }
        if(nextpt!=NULL)
        {
        head->next= reverse(nextpt,k);
        }
        return prevpt;
    }
};
