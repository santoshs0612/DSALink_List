Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
Output: 8
Explanation: In the first example, there
are 9 nodes in linked list and we need
to find 2nd node from end. 2nd node
from end is 8.  
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
LinkedList: 10->5->100->5
Output: -1
Explanation: In the second example, there
are 4 nodes in the linked list and we
need to find 5th from the end. Since 'n'
is more than the number of nodes in the
linked list, the output is -1.




/* struct Node {
  int data;
  struct Node *next;
  Node(int x) {
    data = x;
    next = NULL;
  }
};

//Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
int getNthFromLast(Node *head, int n)
{
       // Your code here
       
       Node* curr= head;
       int count=0;
       while(curr!=NULL)
       {
           curr=curr->next;
           count++;
       }
       
        count = count-n;
       
       if(count<0)
       {
           return -1;
       }
       curr=head;
       while(count)
       {
           curr=curr->next;
           count--;
       }
       return curr->data;
}
